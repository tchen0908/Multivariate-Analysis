This data set describes seven measured geometric parameters of 205 wheat kernels which belong to three different types of wheat: Kama (Y=1), Rosa (Y=2) and Canadian (Y=3).

X1 = area (mm^2)
X2 = perimeter (mm)
X3 = compactness (4*pi*area/perimeter^2)
X4 = length of kernel (mm)
X5 = width of kernel (mm)
X6 = asymmetry coefficient
X7 = length of kernel groove (mm)
